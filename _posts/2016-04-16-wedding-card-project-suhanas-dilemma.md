Creating a
wedding card for Suhana was not an easy task. Suhana has a very strong
personality hence she has a very clear thought of what she wants, that simply
means when she came to me and asked for a 'tailored design', she really meant a
'100%-only-Suhana' design for her wedding  card.

After a few meet-up
to get to know more about the couples, some seed ideas were planted. Getting to
know Sue is actively involved in many many corporate/social events and the fact
that she's obsessed with many interests, helped big time in creating ideas of
her card. 

We decided to play
along with the idea of  'a charming lady having dilemma in a speed dating
event'. And yes, 'Speed-dating" is one of the events that Sue aggressively
conduct and promote.

So, the card will
feature a 'rotating table' like of those seen in a speed-dating event, then the
invitees will need to help Sue to solve her dilemmas, adding some fun and
interactive gimmick. 

The colour of the card is not the
typical colours that we should use for a wedding card, I must say. BUT Suhana
insisted it, and well -- this is what 'personalised' is about. The color
reflects her helpless fantasy towards the Malay College Kuala Kangsar (MCKK)
boys, which, Azlan is one of them. 

So here's the end product:
