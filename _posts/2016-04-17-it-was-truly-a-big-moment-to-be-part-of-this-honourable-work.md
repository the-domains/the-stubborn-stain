It
was truly a big moment to be part of this honourable work -- helping up in an
event of Malaysian Association for Blinds (MAB). This event is called
"Battle of the Bands", which actually runs for years already but due to
their limited resources and marketing exposure, the event stayed only among
their fraternity. 

PETRONITA, a
"female staff and staff's wives club" of PETRONAS gracefully
volunteered to help them up for this year's edition of Battle of The Bands.
Well neither a member of MAB nor PETRONITA, I'm in, just to help. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ea74129f-2363-446d-acc0-a4663bcf082b.png)

Back
to my work. Come to rebranding the event, first task for me was to help
"Battle of the Band" to create a logo that reflects the nature of the
event: musical, and rock. I designed a guitar on fire, intended to create the
furious and independant impression -- this is very important as we wanted to
give a brand new image for blind musicians -- they are not at all the ones we
ever imagined and saw in the night market. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a54e2742-2f0b-4e80-bcbc-108115082634.png)

However,
during my research I found out there are too many "Battle of the
Bands" flooded on web that made this event lost its significance as one of
the kinds. We decided the put a tag line, or more like a sub-line theme: 

A
Battle Beyond Sight. 

The
community loved it, and more importantly, we didn't use the word
"Blind" or "Sight-less" which were quite sensitive to refer
to. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/652a4682-21ee-4432-a883-1af978f008c6.jpg)
